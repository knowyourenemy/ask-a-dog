## Ask a Dog!

This project answers any question you give it with an image of a dog and a quote.

# API Calls

This project uses the Axios library to fetch a random image from <a href='https://dog.ceo/dog-api/'> this Dog API</a>.

The quotes are stored locally, and have been obtained from <a href='https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/free-api-inspirational-quotes-json-with-code-examples/311373/9'>this quotes API</a>.

# Future Plans

I really wanted to include a button that allows users to download or share the results. I tried implementing this using the html-to-image library, but it did not work well with iOS devices. As such, I did not commit it to the main branch.

# Acknowledgements

Thank you to Ruth Lim for helping me with the design.
